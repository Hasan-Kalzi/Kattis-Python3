import sys

while True:
    # Input has one test case per line. Each test case contains two integers in the range [1,231âˆ’1]. The first number
    # is the numerator and the second is the denominator. A line containing 0 0 will follow the last test case.
    numerator, denominator = [int(_) for _ in sys.stdin.readline().split()]
    if numerator == 0 and denominator == 0:
